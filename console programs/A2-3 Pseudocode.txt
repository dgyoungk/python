reading from pbnumbers.txt and storing it into a 2D list
search through the file and display the 10 most common numbers
and 10 least common numbers

nested loops to store file contents into 2D list
dict to hold the numbers and their frequencies
list to hold the 10 largest frequencies (top_ten = [0] * 10)
list to hold the 10 smallest frequencies (bott_ten = [0] * 10)

dict of the 10 most common numbers (number:frequency)
dict of the 10 least common numbers (number:frequency)

function to get frequencies: pass 2D list, number to count
	declare count var
	loop through the 2D list to get frequency
	return count that will be the value to frequency dict
				with number to count as the key


function to determine the 10 largest frequencies: pass frequency dict
    top_ten = [0] * 10
    for k,v in frequency.items():
	if v > top_ten[0]:
	    assign value to top_ten[0]

	elif value < top_ten[0] and value > top_ten[1]:
	    assign value to top_ten[1]

	elif value < top_ten[1] and value > top_ten[2]:
	    assign value to top_ten[2]

	elif value < top_ten[2] and value > top_ten[3]:
	    assign value to top_ten[3]

	elif value < top_ten[3] and value > top_ten[4]:
	    assign value to top_ten[4]

	elif value < top_ten[4] and value > top_ten[5]:
	    assign value to top_ten[5]

	elif value < top_ten[5] and value > top_ten[6]:
	    assign value to top_ten[6]

	elif value < top_ten[6] and value > top_ten[7]:
	    assign value to top_ten[7]

	elif value < top_ten[7] and value > top_ten[8]:
	    assign value to top_ten[8]

	elif value < top_ten[8] and value > top_ten[9]:
	    assign value to top_ten[9]

    return top_ten


function to determine the 10 smallest frequencies: pass frequency dict
    bott_ten = [0] * 10
    for k,v in frequency.items():
	loop through the list (for num in range(len(bott_ten)):)
   	    if value < bott_ten[num]:
		bott_ten.append(value)

    return bott_ten

function to match the frequency in top/bottom 10 list with the frequency in dict: pass dict, list (either top/bottom 10)
    declare dict to hold the 10 numbers (finalists = dict())
    
    loop through the dict (for k, v in frequency.items():)
	loop through the list (for index in range(len(top/bottom 10 list)):)
	    if v equals list[index]:
		finalists[k] = v

    return finalists
